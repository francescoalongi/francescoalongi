### Hello, world ðŸ‘‹

I'm Francesco Alongi, a MSc student of Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano who is mainly interested in Data Science & Machine Learning.
I'm a curious person and I am learning new things everyday, not by chance my motto is "never stop improving yourself".

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my thesis which is about the textual explainability of deepfakes
