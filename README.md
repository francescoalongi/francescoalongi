### Hello, world 👋

I'm Francesco Alongi, a graduate of the MSc course Computer Science and Engineering at Politecnico di Milano. I'm mainly interested in Data Science, Machine Learning and basically everything which help humans in making machines act autonomously.
I'm a curious person and I am learning new things everyday, not by chance my motto is "never stop improving yourself".
